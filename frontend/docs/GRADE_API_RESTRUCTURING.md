# Grade API Restructuring

## Overview
The Grade Register API has been restructured to follow the same pattern as other registers in the application. The API routes now act as proxies that forward requests to the backend API, rather than implementing mock data locally.

## Changes Made

### ✅ API Route Structure
**Before**: Mock implementations with local data storage
**After**: Proxy routes that forward to backend API

### ✅ Updated Files

#### 1. `apps/registers/app/api/grades/route.ts`
- **GET**: Forwards to `http://localhost:5082/api/Grade/GetGrades`
- **POST**: Forwards to `http://localhost:5082/api/Grade/AddOrUpdateGrade`
- Removed mock data implementation
- Added proper error handling and logging

#### 2. `apps/registers/app/api/grades/[id]/route.ts`
- **GET**: Forwards to `http://localhost:5082/api/Grade/GetGradeById/{id}`
- **DELETE**: Forwards to `http://localhost:5082/api/Grade/DeleteGrade/{id}`
- Removed mock data implementation
- Added proper error handling and logging

#### 3. Removed `apps/registers/app/api/grades/data.ts`
- No longer needed since we're not using mock data

### ✅ Maintained Files (No Changes Needed)

#### `packages/ui/libs/registers/grades/services.ts`
- Already correctly configured to use the API client
- Makes requests to Next.js API routes which proxy to backend
- No changes required

#### `packages/ui/libs/registers/grades/models.ts`
- Grade interface and types remain the same
- No changes required

#### `packages/ui/libs/registers/grades/defaultGrade.ts`
- Default grade values remain the same
- No changes required

#### `packages/ui/libs/registers/grades/gradeFormSchema.ts`
- Validation schema remains the same
- No changes required

## API Flow

```
Frontend Component
    ↓
packages/ui/libs/registers/grades/services.ts
    ↓
Next.js API Route (apps/registers/app/api/grades/route.ts)
    ↓
Backend API (http://localhost:5082/api/Grade/*)
    ↓
Database
```

## Backend API Endpoints Expected

The backend should implement these endpoints:

- `GET /api/Grade/GetGrades` - Get all grades
- `POST /api/Grade/AddOrUpdateGrade` - Create or update grade
- `GET /api/Grade/GetGradeById/{id}` - Get specific grade
- `DELETE /api/Grade/DeleteGrade/{id}` - Delete specific grade

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as other registers (ports, ships)
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles UI, backend handles data
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add caching, authentication, etc. at the API level
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between frontend and backend logic
5. **Testing**: Can test frontend and backend independently

## Error Handling

The API routes now include:
- Proper error logging with console output
- HTTP status code forwarding
- User-friendly error messages
- Request/response logging for debugging

## Logging

All API calls now include console logging:
- Request URL and method
- Response status
- Data received
- Error details

This makes debugging much easier when integrating with the backend.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: The backend team needs to implement the Grade API endpoints
2. **Testing**: Test the API integration once backend is ready
3. **Error Handling**: Add more specific error handling based on backend responses
4. **Authentication**: Add authentication headers if required by backend

The Grade Register is now properly structured to work with a real backend API while maintaining the same user experience and functionality.
