Domain Driven Design ‚Äì Shipnet Commercial 2.0

**VMS Domain Model (MVP Scope)**

This model includes:

Core domain entities

Relationships and ownership structure

Candidate **registers** (Master Data / Admin Configurable)

**1. Company (Tenant)**

Implicit in schema-per-tenant ‚Äî not a table, but a context.

Every entity below is scoped to one tenant schema.

Tenants are uniquely identified by **subdomain** (*chemship**.shipnet.app*).

**2. User**

Represents authenticated users per company

**3****. Vessel ****üü©**** *****(Register)***

Master data for ships operated by the tenant. Reused across voyages.

**4.**** ****VoyageEstimate**** ****‚Äì becomes a full voyage when confirmed**

**5****. Voyage**

Core model of a confirmed voyage.

**6****. ****PortCall**

Models one stop in the voyage. Each voyage may have multiple PortCalls.

**7****. Cargo**

Belongs to a voyage, and associated with a port call.

**8****. ****VoyageEvent**

Time-stamped log of voyage-related milestones or exceptions

**9****. ****P&LItem**** *****(Optional per voyage financials)***

Tracks revenue and cost components

**üü©**** Registers / Admin-Configurable Master Data**

These are the entities your admin UI should support managing:

**üîó**** Relationships Summary**

Company ‚Üí Owns all data (via schema or context)

Vessel ‚Üí Has many Voyages and Estimates

One Voyage can have many estimates

Voyage ‚Üí Has many PortCalls, Cargo, VoyageEvents, P&LItems

PortCall ‚Üí Optional Cargo

User ‚Üí Creates Events, owns actions (audit/log)
