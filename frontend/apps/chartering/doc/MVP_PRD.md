# Feature Breakdown with User Stories

## Voyage Planning & Scheduling

- As an Operations Manager, I want to input voyage details (origin, destination, cargo) and get an auto-calculated ETD/ETA so that I can set up a voyage quickly. This should be intelligent - drawing from historical data, giving me realistic (as well as CP) estimates.

- As a Chartering Manager, I want to test different voyage scenarios to assess their profitability before confirming a fixture. This should be as easy as possible, the ability to quickly generate a range of scenarios, and explore â€˜what ifâ€™ scenarios for each.

## Real-Time Voyage Tracking

- As an Ops Manager, I want to see my vesselâ€™s live position on a map so I can assess schedule accuracy and how the vessel is performing.

- As a Director, I want a high-level status dashboard showing voyage progress so I can spot issues at a glance.

## Voyage Timeline, Alerts & Notifications

- As an Ops Manager, I want to be alerted when a voyage deviates from the plan so I can take action quickly.

- As a Chartering Manager, I want to receive email alerts when ETAs change so I can notify stakeholders or adjust future plans.

## Basic Voyage Financials (Voyage P&L)

- As a Commercial Manager, I want to enter voyage revenue and costs so I can calculate margin and TCE.

- As a Director, I want to view a summary of voyage P&Ls so I can assess overall performance.

## Multi-User Collaboration

- As an Admin, I want to manage user access and roles so each team member can see what they need.

- As an Ops Manager, I want to log voyage events centrally so that everyone is aligned on voyage status.

## Guided Onboarding & Intuitive UI

- As a new user, I want a setup checklist and in-app guidance so I can start using the system without external help.

- As a Director, I want confidence that my team can onboard without weeks of training.

## External System Integration (Essential APIs Only)

- As an Ops Manager, I want the system to fetch voyage distances automatically so I donâ€™t have to enter them manually.

- As any User, I want to be able to access data from Helix.

- As a Developer/Admin, I want future-proof APIs so we can expand integrations later as needed.

- Full accounting suite (invoicing, GL integration)

- Emissions and compliance tracking (EEXI, CII) (this is likely partially covered with simple calculations/reports)

- Predictive analytics or AI-based voyage optimization
