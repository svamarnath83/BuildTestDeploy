# DbContext Separation Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented the separation of ShipnetDbContext into two distinct contexts:

1. **MultiTenantSnContext**
   - Purpose: Handles tenant-specific data with dynamic schema selection
   - Tables: Ports, DistanceSources, Grades, Estimates, CurrencyTypes, UnitsOfMeasure, Commodities, Vessels, VesselGrades, VesselTypes, ConfigSetting
   - Used by: All tenant-specific services (PortService, GradeService, etc.)

2. **AdminContext**
   - Purpose: Handles system-wide configuration and tenant management
   - Tables: Subscriptions, SystemConfigurations (mapped to public.configurations)
   - Used by: SchemaAccessor, TideformBunkerPriceService
   - Always uses the "public" schema

## Implementation Details

1. **DB Context Creation**
   - Created separate context classes with appropriate DbSet properties
   - Maintained existing entity configurations
   - Added schema-specific model cache key factory

2. **Service Updates**
   - Updated PortService to use MultiTenantSnContext
   - Updated TideformBunkerPriceService to use AdminContext for system-wide configurations
   - Updated SchemaAccessor to use AdminContext for tenant lookup
   - Updated BaseApi to support MultiTenantSnContext

3. **DI Registration**
   - Registered both contexts with appropriate lifetime scopes
   - Maintained factory pattern for MultiTenantSnContext with dynamic schema support
   - AdminContext is directly injected with standard DbContext lifetime

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: System administration separated from tenant data
- **Security**: Better isolation between tenant data and system configuration
- **Performance**: Optimized connection pooling for different usage patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clearer code organization with context-specific responsibilities

## Next Steps

Complete the migration of remaining services according to the migration plan:

1. Update remaining service constructors to use the appropriate context
2. Ensure all API functions use the appropriate context for their dependencies
3. Add comprehensive tests for both contexts to verify isolation and functionality

The application can continue to evolve with this improved architecture, making it easier to add new features while maintaining proper separation between tenant data and system administration.
