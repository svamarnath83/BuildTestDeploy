# üöÄ CD Pipeline Documentation (`cd.yml`)

This document provides comprehensive line-by-line documentation for the Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline of the Shipnet 2.0 project.

## üéØ Pipeline Overview

The CD pipeline is responsible for:
- Deploying the .NET backend Azure Functions to local environment
- Deploying all 6 Next.js frontend applications with proper port configuration
- Performing health checks and validation
- Managing rollback procedures in case of failures
- Providing deployment status and cleanup

---

## üìã Pipeline Configuration

### Workflow Name and Triggers

```yaml
name: CD Pipeline - Shipnet 2.0
```
**Purpose:** Defines the display name for this workflow in GitHub Actions UI

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI Pipeline - Shipnet 2.0"]
    types:
      - completed
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        default: 'development'
        type: choice
        options:
          - development
          - staging
          - production
```

**Trigger Types:**
- **workflow_run:** Automatically runs after CI pipeline completes successfully
- **workflow_dispatch:** Manual trigger with environment selection
- **Branch Filter:** Only deploys from main and develop branches

### Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  DOTNET_VERSION: '8.0.x'
  NODE_VERSION: '20.x'
  AZURE_FUNCTIONS_CORE_TOOLS_VERSION: '4'
```

**Variable Breakdown:**
- **DOTNET_VERSION:** Ensures .NET 8.0 compatibility for Azure Functions
- **NODE_VERSION:** Node.js 20.x for frontend runtime
- **AZURE_FUNCTIONS_CORE_TOOLS_VERSION:** Version 4 for local Azure Functions deployment

## üîç Job 1: Pre-Deployment Checks

### Job Configuration
```yaml
pre-deployment:
    name: Pre-deployment Checks
    runs-on: self-hosted
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
```
**Purpose:** Validates environment before deployment begins
**Runner:** Uses self-hosted runner for local deployment access
**Condition:** Only runs if CI pipeline succeeded or manual trigger

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. Repository Checkout
```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```
**Purpose:** Gets the latest source code for deployment scripts

#### 2. Port Availability Check
```yaml
- name: Check port availability
  run: |
    Write-Host "Checking required ports..."
    $ports = @(7071, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3006)
    $unavailable = @()
    
    foreach ($port in $ports) {
        try {
            $listener = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener]::new([System.Net.IPAddress]::Any, $port)
            $listener.Start()
            $listener.Stop()
            Write-Host "‚úÖ Port $port is available"
        } catch {
            Write-Host "‚ùå Port $port is in use"
            $unavailable += $port
        }
    }
    
    if ($unavailable.Count -gt 0) {
        Write-Host "‚ùå The following ports are unavailable: $($unavailable -join ', ')"
        Write-Host "Please stop services using these ports before deployment."
        exit 1
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ All required ports are available for deployment"
    }
  shell: pwsh
```
**Purpose:** Ensures all required ports are available before deployment
**Port List:**
- 7071: Azure Functions (backend)
- 3001: Chartering app
- 3002: Registers app  
- 3003: Home app
- 3004: Accounting app
- 3005: Voyagemanager app
- 3006: Auth app

**Logic:** 
- Tests TCP listener on each port
- Collects unavailable ports
- Fails deployment if any ports are blocked

#### 3. Disk Space Check
```yaml
- name: Check disk space
  run: |
    $drive = Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter "DeviceID='C:'"
    $freeSpaceGB = [math]::Round($drive.FreeSpace / 1GB, 2)
    $totalSpaceGB = [math]::Round($drive.Size / 1GB, 2)
    
    Write-Host "üíΩ Disk Space Status:"
    Write-Host "Free Space: $freeSpaceGB GB"
    Write-Host "Total Space: $totalSpaceGB GB"
    
    if ($freeSpaceGB -lt 5) {
        Write-Host "‚ùå Insufficient disk space. Need at least 5GB free."
        exit 1
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ Sufficient disk space available"
    }
  shell: pwsh
```
**Purpose:** Ensures adequate disk space for deployment
**Threshold:** Requires minimum 5GB free space
**Monitoring:** Reports current space usage

#### 4. Process Cleanup
```yaml
- name: Stop existing processes
  run: |
    Write-Host "üßπ Cleaning up existing processes..."
    
    # Stop Azure Functions processes
    Get-Process -Name "func" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
    Get-Process -Name "dotnet" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "dotnet" } | Stop-Process -Force
    
    # Stop Node.js processes on our ports
    $ports = @(3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3006)
    foreach ($port in $ports) {
        $processes = netstat -ano | Select-String ":$port " | ForEach-Object {
            $_.ToString().Split()[-1]
        }
        foreach ($pid in $processes) {
            if ($pid -match '^\d+$') {
                try {
                    Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                    Write-Host "Stopped process $pid on port $port"
                } catch {
                    Write-Host "Could not stop process $pid"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Process cleanup completed"
  shell: pwsh
  continue-on-error: true
```
**Purpose:** Stops existing processes to free ports for new deployment
**Process Types:**
- Azure Functions (`func` command)
- .NET applications (`dotnet`)
- Node.js apps on specific ports

**Safety:** Uses `continue-on-error` to prevent deployment failure if cleanup issues occur
