# Grade Register Implementation

## Overview
The Grade Register has been successfully implemented following the same architecture and patterns as the existing Port Register. It provides full CRUD functionality for managing grades with their pricing information.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Full CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new grades with name, price, and in-use status
- **Read**: Display paginated list of grades with filtering and sorting
- **Update**: Edit existing grade information
- **Delete**: Remove grades with confirmation dialog

### ✅ Data Model
```typescript
interface Grade {
  Id: number;        // Unique identifier
  Name: string;      // Grade name
  Price: number;     // Price value
  InUse: boolean;    // Active status
}
```

### ✅ UI Components
- **GradeExplorer**: Main table view with CRUD operations
- **GradeForm**: Add/Edit form with validation
- **GradeInfo**: Form section for grade information
- **DynamicDeleteDialog**: Confirmation dialog for deletions

### ✅ API Endpoints
- `GET /api/grades` - Get all grades
- `POST /api/grades` - Create or update grade
- `GET /api/grades/[id]` - Get specific grade
- `DELETE /api/grades/[id]` - Delete specific grade

### ✅ Form Validation
- Name: Required field
- Price: Required, non-negative number
- InUse: Boolean checkbox

### ✅ State Management
- Loading states for async operations
- Form state management
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Toast notifications for all operations

```

## Usage

### Accessing the Grade Register
Navigate to `/grades` in the application to view the Grade Register.

### Adding a New Grade
1. Click the "Add" button in the Grade Register
2. Fill in the grade name, price, and set the "In Use" status
3. Click "Create Grade" to save

### Editing a Grade
1. Click on any grade row or use the edit button
2. Modify the grade information
3. Click "Update Grade" to save changes

### Deleting a Grade
1. Click the delete button for the grade
2. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
3. The grade will be removed from the list

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Consistency
- Follows the same patterns as Port Register
- Reuses shared UI components and utilities
- Maintains consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Uses the same notification system

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Proper interface definitions
- Type-safe form handling
- Validation with Zod schemas

### Error Handling
- API error handling with user feedback
- Form validation with inline error display
- Network error recovery
- Graceful fallbacks

### Performance
- Efficient data loading
- Optimistic UI updates
- Proper state management
- Minimal re-renders

## API Integration

The Grade Register uses a mock API implementation that can be easily replaced with real backend endpoints. The API structure follows RESTful conventions:

- **GET /api/grades** - Retrieve all grades
- **POST /api/grades** - Create or update grade (determined by Id presence)
- **GET /api/grades/[id]** - Get specific grade by ID
- **DELETE /api/grades/[id]** - Delete grade by ID

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Advanced filtering options
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality
- Audit trail
- Price history tracking
- Integration with other modules

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Proper error handling
- Form validation
- API response handling
- User interaction flows

The Grade Register is now ready for use and follows all the established patterns and conventions of the Shipnet 2.0 application.
